# MyFlightbookWeb
The website and services for MyFlightbook. This provides the back-end for the mobile apps as well.

 ## Getting Started
 ### Setting up the website
 * Run on any Windows machine with ASP.NET 4.5 or later.
 * Make sure IIS has ASP turned on under "application development features".
 * Make sure IIS has HTTP Redirection turned on under Internet Information Services/World Wide Web Services/Common HTTP Features
 * Create 6 folders under "Images": "Aircraft", "BasicMed", "Endorsements", "OfflineEndorsements", "Flights", and "Telemetry".  Set permissions on them so that Network Service has full control (so that the website can write thumbnails to these folders).  
 NOTE: Visual studio debugging can get very slow if these contain a lot of files/folders, so it's a good idea to mark them as hidden in the file system (top level only is sufficient).
 * Add the following web.config to the Telemetry folder created above, so that it can't serve telemetry directly:
 ~~~~
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <authorization>
      <deny users="?" />
      <deny users="*"/>
    </authorization>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
 ~~~~
 * Set up the virtual directory for "logbook" pointing to your working directory, convert it to an application. Use ASP.NET 4.5 or later as your application pool. A lot of items point to /logbook, so the root should be the parent folder
and the application should be called "logbook" and point to the /logbook branch.
 * Set up a certificate to enable https.
 * Make sure that IIS is set up to serve .KML, .GPX, .PDF, .JPG, .DOCX, .APK (application/vnd.android.package-archive) etc.
 * Add email.config to App_Data so that you can send email:
~~~~
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<smtp deliveryMethod="Network" from="(your email address)">
    <network defaultCredentials="false" port="587" host="..." userName="..." password="..." />
</smtp>
~~~~
 * Add connection.config to App_Data so that you can talk to the database:
 ~~~~
 <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="logbookConnectionString" connectionString="server=...;User Id=...;password=...;Persist Security Info=false;database=logbook;CharSet=utf8mb4;Pooling=false" providerName="MySql.Data.MySqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>
~~~~
 * Review Packages.config and install the requisite products/DLLs (typically via NuGet) into the Bin directory.
 
 ### Setting up the database
 * Install MySQL and import "MinimalDB-xxxx-xx-xx.sql" (in the Support folder), then apply any/all scripts in that folder that are after that date.  The scripts all assue that your database schema is "logbook" (see connection.config above), but you can use any connection you like; just be sure to edit the update scripts if you use other than "logbook".
 * Populate the LocalConfig table with values for the relevant keys.  LocalConfig is for keys and secrets (e.g., oAuth access/secret pairs) that one doesn't want to have in the code, and this is necessary for mapping, social media, etc. to work.  A development site should work without most of these, but will have degraded functionality.  See below for LocalConfig settings and what they mean
 * Need to set packet size to at least 10-15MB:	show variables like 'max_allowed_packet';	SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16777216.
 * Not a bad idea to bump up group_concat_max_len to something like 2048.
 * Depending on where MySQL is hosted, may need to set  lower_case_table_names=1, since the code is not consistent about upper/lower case for table names.
 * If on 5.7, may need any of the following: 
 * sql_mode ALLOW_INVALID_DATES

 ### Additional items
* Install [WKHtmlToPdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) to create PDFs. Download link is [here](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-1/wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.msvc2015-win64.exe)

### Live Site Only
These are tasks to do ONLY on the live site; there should be no need to set them up on a development environment:
* Set up a scheduled task to send nightly stats, delete drop-box cache, send nightly email.
* Install root files (support directory) so that http://xxx/ will go straight to the default home page, and so that favicon.ico will work. Need to edit the file and ensure that default.aspx is the top-level default doc.
* Ensure reverse DNS is set up for host so that email can be received
* Set up custom errors in web.config, but TURN THEM OFF in IIS so that oAuth will return errors. IIS->(site)->Error Pages->Edit Feature Settings->Detailed Errors.
* Use a custom application pool.  Then, in IIS Manager go to that pool and under "Edit Application Pool", click "Recycling...".  Set the pool to automatically recycle once daily (I use 10pm) and if it uses too much memory (I use 2000000KB - i.e., 2GB)
* Ensure that 3306 (database) port is closed, ensure that firewall is otherwise appropriately configured
