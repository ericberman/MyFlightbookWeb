       You can define custom deadlines that will appear in your currency.  The difference from other currencies is that a deadline isn't impacted by your flying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples include:
            <ul>
                <li>Certificate/registration expirations</li>
                <li>Inspections mandated by airworthiness directives</li>
                <li>Employer-imposed deadlines</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        A deadline may be due based on a calendar date, or, if associated with an aircraft, by the hours on that aircraft (typically hobbs or tachometer).
    </p>
    <p>Deadlines that you create in your profile are private to you.  Deadlines you create from an aircraft's details page are &quot;owned&quot; by the aircraft, and may be viewed/edited by any pilot who flies that aircraft.
