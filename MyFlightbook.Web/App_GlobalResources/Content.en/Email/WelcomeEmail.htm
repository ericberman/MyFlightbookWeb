	<p>Welcome to %APP_NAME%, an online pilot's logbook.</p>
	<p>%APP_NAME% keeps your logbook in the cloud, so you have access to it from anywhere and any device.  (It's your data, so you always have the ability to download it from the <a href="https://%APP_URL%">%APP_NAME% Website</a>.)</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Keep track of your total times, including sub-totals based on specific queries.</li>
