    <p>Dear {0}:</p>
    <p>You currently have <span style="font-weight:bold">{1:#,###}</span> pending flights in your account on %APP_NAME%</p>

    <p>
        These flights are not yet part of your logbook, and as such they do not contribute towards your totals or your currency.  They are likely flights that resulted from an import, but which need errors corrected or additional information before
        they can be added to your logbook.
    </p>

    <p>You can <a href="https://%APP_URL%%APP_ROOT%/Member/ReviewPendingFlights.aspx">review these flights</a> - or bulk delete them - by visiting "Pending Flights" under the "Logbook" tab on the website.</p>

    <p>Thank-you for using %APP_NAME%!</p>
