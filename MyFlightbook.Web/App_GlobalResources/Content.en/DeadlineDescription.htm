    <p>You can define custom deadlines that will appear in your currency.  The difference from other currencies is that a deadline isn't impacted by your flying, but rather by the passage of time (or, for aircraft, aircraft usage).</p>
    <p>
        Examples include:
            <ul>
                <li>Certificate/registration expirations.  Particularly useful if you have multiple certificates (e.g., FAA and EASA)</li>
                <li>Additional medical certificates, if you have more than one</li>
                <li>Inspections mandated by airworthiness directives</li>
                <li>Employer-imposed deadlines</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
    <p>A deadline may be due based on a calendar date, or, if associated with an aircraft, by the hours on that aircraft (typically hobbs or tachometer).</p>
    <p>Deadlines that you create in your profile are private to you.  Deadlines you create from an aircraft's details page are &quot;owned&quot; by the aircraft, and may be viewed/edited by any pilot who flies that aircraft.</p>
