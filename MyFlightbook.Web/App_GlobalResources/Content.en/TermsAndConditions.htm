<p>%APP_NAME% was created as an open source free service for the worldwide flying community.</p>
<p>We respect your privacy and do NOT sell or share your data; see our <a href="%APP_ROOT%/mvc/pub/privacy">privacy policy</a> for more information.</p>
<p>As a free service, we cannot make any promises regarding service levels, accuracy of data or computations, or the quality of the software. (Although we believe it is all robust, accurate, and high quality).</p>
<p>While the database is regularly backed up, there is a feature to back-up your data to a spreadsheet - it's not a bad idea to use that now and then just in case.</p>
<p>If you find a bug or have a feature request, <a href="%APP_ROOT%/mvc/pub/contact">let us know</a>.  Pilots are the best source of feature ideas!</p>
