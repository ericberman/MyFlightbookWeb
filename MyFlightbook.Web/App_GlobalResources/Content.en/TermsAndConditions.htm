	I built this site to meet my own needs and share it because I believe it can be very broadly useful.
	However, I cannot make any promises regarding service levels, accuracy of data or computations, or the quality of the software. (Although
	frankly I think it's pretty good and pretty bug free).
</p>
<p>While I back up the database nightly, there is a feature to back-up your data to
a spreadsheet - it's not a bad idea to use that now and then just in case.</p>
<p>
	If you find a bug or have a feature request, <a href="%APP_ROOT%/mvc/pub/contact">let me know</a>,
	and I will see what I can do.
