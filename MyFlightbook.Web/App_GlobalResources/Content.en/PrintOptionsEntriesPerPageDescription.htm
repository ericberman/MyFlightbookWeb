<p>This is an approximate number of flights per page because the height of each row cannot be determined with accuracy before rendering of the entire page.</p>
<p>The system does try to adjust the row height based on the data a given flight contains - more data is assumed to require more height, reducing the number of flights on the containing page,
    but this is just an approximation.  Things that contribute to "more height" include: long comments, lots of properties, images (if images are included in the print view) and signatures 
    (if signatures are included)
</p>
<p>Please read <a href="https://myflightbookblog.blogspot.com/2019/01/printing-from-electronic-logbook-and.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for some fascinating insights into why. 
    That said, I encourage the use of "continuous" mode because it avoids all of the approximation issues while sacrificing no functionality that has any actual (vs. perceived) value.</p>
<p>If you want per-page subtotals and a reasonably consistent number of flights per page, there are some things that you can do to ensure that each flight takes a similar height:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Exclude images from the print view (and signatures too)</li>
    <li>Exclude properties that aren't typically needed in a print layout (such as fuel price, for example)</li>
    <li>In comments, if you use "///", everything after that will be excluded from printing.  E.g., "First Solo /// Winds 090@10G15" will print out simply as "First Solo"</li>
    <li>In comments, if you use "///--", it behaves as "///" above, but it also ensures that the flight will start a new page</li>
    <li>You can also adjust pagination manually below. Click a flight to designate it to be the first flight on a new page; you will see a red top border to indicate that this has been so designated (the red will not print or show in the PDF). 
    Click the red-top-bordered flight again to remove the designation and the flight will resume its position in regular pagination flow</li>
</ul>
