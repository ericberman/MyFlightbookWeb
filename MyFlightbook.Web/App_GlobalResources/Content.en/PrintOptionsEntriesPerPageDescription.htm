<p>This is an approximate number of flights per page because (by default) the height of each row grows or shrinks to fit its data.</p>
<p>More data is assumed to requires height, reducing the number of flights on the containing page, but this is just an approximation.</p>
<p>Things that contribute to "more height" include: long comments, lots of properties, images (if images are included in the print view) and signatures (if signatures are included).</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can specify a specific row height.  This forces the tradeoff in the other direction: each entry is allocated a fixed height on the page (and thus flights-per-page is exact), but any data that does not fit does not get displayed</p>

    "Continuous" mode has the advantage of avoiding all of the approximation issues while sacrificing no functionality that has any actual (vs. perceived) value.</p>
<p>If you want per-page subtotals and a reasonably consistent number of flights per page, there are some things that you can do to ensure that each flight takes a similar height:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Specify a row height, making the tradeoff described above.  Then flights-per-page becomes exact, but you may not display all data.</li>
    <li>Exclude images from the print view (and signatures too)</li>
    <li>Exclude properties that aren't typically needed in a print layout (such as fuel price, for example)</li>
    <li>In comments, if you use "///", everything after that will be excluded from printing.  E.g., "First Solo /// Winds 090@10G15" will print out simply as "First Solo"</li>
    <li>In comments, if you use "///--", it behaves as "///" above, but it also ensures that the flight will start a new page</li>
    <li>You can also adjust pagination manually below. Click a flight to designate it to be the first flight on a new page; you will see a red top border to indicate that this has been so designated (the red will not print or show in the PDF). 
    Click the red-top-bordered flight again to remove the designation and the flight will resume its position in regular pagination flow</li>
</ul>
