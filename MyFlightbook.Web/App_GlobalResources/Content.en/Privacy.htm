<h2>How we collect and use your personal data</h2>
<p>Below are some examples of how we collect and use your personal data.</p>
<p><span class="b">When you create an account we require email, password, and secret question/answer</span> to secure our services and reach out to you for service-related issues. You may also optionally provide your name so we can address you by name, and so that it can display in a print view.</p>
<p><span class="b">When you use %APP_NAME%</span> we provide the logbook services, manage your account, communicate with you about the Services, and process transactions with you. You may <span class="b">optionally</span> provide additional information in Profile for your own tracking and printing purposes including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your address. We do not send physical mail or share this with any third party; this is used for printing.</li>
    <li>Your pilot license/certificate and expiration (either certificate or recent experience expiration). This is used for printing, for signing flights if you are an instructor, and for tracking expiration dates.</li>
    <li>Date of your medical. This is used for tracking expiration dates.</li>
    <li>Date of birth. This is for tracking expiration dates and can optionally display on a print view.</li>
    <li>Headshot.  This is for display on a print view and to offer a more personalized experience on the site; it is not displayed to others except for the scenario where you are in a club, in which case other club members can see it</li>
    <li>Phone number.  This is for printing and, if you are a member of a club, for display to other club members so that they can reach you.</li>
    <li>Alternative email addresses.  This enables a convenience feature whereby you can accept requests from other pilots that may have been sent to the wrong primary address.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use personal data in some other ways including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To comply with our applicable legal obligations including to exercise or to defend the legal rights of you, us or others; to meet legal requirements for tax, health and safety.</li>
    <li>Based on your consent as clearly disclosed to you at the time of collection.</li>
    <li>To fulfill our legitimate interests in marketing, product improvement, information security, and fraud protection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of personal data we collect</h2>
<p>We collect information you voluntarily provide directly to us and information that we collect automatically when you interact with %APP_NAME%.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contact Information. This includes name, email address, and physical address. We collect this information when you provide it directly to us, for example when you create an account or fill out a form. We collect this information for the purposes of account creation and management, customer service, and website security and maintenance.</li>
    <li>Analytics Information. We collect this automatically as you use %APP_NAME%, including cookies, tracking pixels, tags or similar tools, which may collect information about your browser, device, geolocation, and interactions. We collect this information for the purposes of account creation and management, analytics, customer service, and website security and maintenance. Depending on your choices, we may use location data to help you fill in logbook details, record the route of your flight, and geotag images that you take from within the application.</li>
    <li>Commercial History. This is information about your purchases with or donations to %APP_NAME%.  We collect this information directly from you or from our service providers for the purposes of customer service, security, fraud prevention, and to fulfill our legal obligations.</li>
    <li>Payment Information.  If you choose to donate to %APP_NAME%, our service provider collects your name, address, phone number, and debit or credit card information.  %APP_NAME% does not collect or store this information, but may see name/address/phone number as part of reviewing our service provider&rsquo;s records.  We never see your credit or debit card number.</li>
    <li>Social Media Information. We collect your posts or other information you share on on our Facebook page or other social media to facilitate engagement with %APP_NAME% and the flight community. Please note that your comments will be visible to the public, so you should never share personal information that you would like to keep private.</li>
    <li>User-Generated Content. If you post, upload, comment, or otherwise submit content to %APP_NAME% we collect this information for the purposes of account creation and management and customer service. Please note that <span class="b">aircraft are shared on %APP_NAME%</span>, and thus ALL aircraft images are shared among users who have those aircraft in their accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How we disclose personal data</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Service providers assist us with providing functionality, IT security and support, web hosting, payment processing, chat features, fraud prevention, and identity verification.</li>
    <li>Other parties receive your personal data when you direct it, for example, to share your flights with others you specify. If you share a flight (by explicitly marking it as publicly visible), then visitors to %APP_NAME% will be able to see the geo-tagged image and/or the recorded flight path. But if you don't share it, they won't be able to see it. As noted above ALL aircraft images are shared among users who have those aircraft in their accounts. If you set up a relationship with an Instructor they can issue digital endorsements to you, view (but not edit/delete) those endorsements, and, if you grant them access, view your logbook.</li>
    <li>Regulatory bodies and law enforcement authorities may receive your personal data from us if we determine we need to disclose it in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations or legal requests like court orders or subpoenas. We may otherwise disclose your personal data if necessary to meet our contractual obligations, or if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable to protect your, our, or others&rsquo; rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.</li>
    <li>Parties involved in business transactions may receive your personal data if we are involved in one, such as the sale, merger, acquisition, or transfer of assets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Choices</h3>
<h4>Account management</h4>
<p>You can log in and click on &rsquo;Profile&rsquo; to update or delete your account. Check out our FAQ for more information.</p>
<p>If you choose to delete your account you will receive an emailed copy of your logbook data (just in case), but we delete all of your other information, with two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you are an instructor and have signed flights for a student, your name/email are preserved on the student's record. We do NOT email that email address; rather, it serves as a unique identifier to say that the signer had that email on the date of signing.</li>
    <li>For development and support purposes, we do keep backup copies of the database going back a few months. Usually, only the most recent of these backups is installed on a development machine. Deleting your account does not affect database backups from prior to the deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that if you set up a relationship with an Instructor, the Instructor will have the ability to issue digital endorsements to you and to view (but not edit/delete) endorsements. You can revoke the ability of an instructor to view your logbook at any time. You can also delete the relationship; doing so will prevent them from accessing your account in any way, but will preserve any signatures or endorsements that they provided during the tenure of the relationship. You can, of course, also re-establish the relationship at any time.</p>
